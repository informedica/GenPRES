# Contributing to GenPRES

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the GenPRES project! This document provides guidelines for contributing to our open source medication order entry solution.

## About GenPRES

GenPRES is an open source software initiative to enable a **Safe and Efficient** medication prescriptions, preparation and administration workflow. The project aims to reduce medication errors through Clinical Decision Support Software (CDSS) that handles:

1. Looking up rules and constraints
2. Calculations
3. Verification of correct applications of rules and constraints and subsequent calculations

**Important**: GenPRES is being developed to comply with Medical Device Regulation (MDR) certification guidelines. Documentation and processes related to MDR compliance will be added to the project as development progresses. Contributors should be aware that all code changes must adhere to medical device software development standards and quality requirements.
