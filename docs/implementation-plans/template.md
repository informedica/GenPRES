# Implementation plan for issue <issue number>

## Problem description

Summarise the problem in a sentence or two (refer to the issue if it contains additional context).

## Approaches considered

Briefly list the available options.

## Chosen approach

State which option you've chosen, with justification.

## Confidence

High/Medium/Low

It's okay if you're not sure that the approach is definitely the best one - sometimes it makes sense to go ahead without full confidence. Documenting your confidence is useful in case we want to revisit the implementation later when we have more information.

## Steps

Describe the steps that you'll take, in order, to implement the chosen approach. Adding this detail helps maintainers to think of useful suggestions based on their knowledge of the system. Suggestions might even be something as simple as agreeing with an approach and linking to relevant docs or providing test data that they already have.
