### Priority Implementation Order

#### Phase 1: Critical Foundation (Week 1)

```text
Root Level:
  ❌ CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md
  ❌ SECURITY.md
  ❌ GOVERNANCE.md
  ❌ .editorconfig

.github/:
  ⚠️ PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md (enhance)
  ❌ workflows/format-check.yml
  ❌ workflows/lint.yml
  ❌ ISSUE_TEMPLATE/change_request.md
```

#### Phase 2: Documentation Structure (Week 2)

```text
Root Level:
  ❌ ARCHITECTURE.md
  ❌ MAINTAINERS.md
  ❌ SUPPORT.md

docs/:
  ❌ adr/ (entire directory + first ADRs)
  ❌ api/index.md
  ❌ guides/contributor-guide.md
```

#### Phase 3: MDR Enhancements (Week 3)

```text
docs/mdr/:
  ❌ clinical-evaluation/ (entire directory)
  ❌ change-control/ (entire directory)
  ❌ post-market/adverse-event-procedure.md
  ❌ requirements/traceability-automated.json
```

#### Phase 4: Automation & Quality (Ongoing)

```text
.github/workflows/:
  ❌ test.yml
  ❌ coverage.yml
  ❌ security-scan.yml
  ❌ sbom-generate.yml
  ❌ release.yml

artifacts/:
  ❌ sbom.json (auto-generated)
  
scripts/:
  ❌ pre-commit-hook.sh
  ❌ generate-sbom.sh
```

### File Naming Conventions

- **Root community files**: UPPERCASE.md (e.g., `README.md`, `SECURITY.md`)
- **Documentation**: lowercase-with-hyphens.md (e.g., `user-guide.md`)
- **MDR documents**: lowercase-with-hyphens.md (e.g., `risk-management-plan.md`)
- **ADRs**: `NNNN-short-title.md` (e.g., `0001-use-safe-stack.md`)
- **Configuration**: lowercase or project-standard (e.g., `.editorconfig`, `fantomas-config.json`)

### Cross-References

Many missing root-level files should link to detailed MDR documentation:

- `ARCHITECTURE.md` → `docs/mdr/design-history/0001-system-architecture.md`
- `ROADMAP.md` → `docs/roadmap/genpres-architecture-and-timeline.md`
- `CHANGELOG.md` (user-facing) ≠ `docs/mdr/design-history/0000-change-log.md` (developer)
- ADRs should reference design history files for detailed technical decisions
