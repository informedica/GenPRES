## Author checklist

- [ ] The described changes have already been described in an issue: #<issue number>
- [ ] This PR documents the plan in a markdown file in [./docs/implementation-plans/](./docs/implementation-plans/).
- [ ] I have used [the implementation plan template](./docs/implementation-plans/template.md).
- [ ] The plan has enough detail: any suggestions that a reveiewer adds to a PR that implements the plan are likely to
be relatively quick to implement (intentionally vague to leave room for flexibility!).

## Reviewer checklist

- [ ] The chosen approach is a good choice.
- [ ] The sequence of steps is complete and sensible.
- [ ] I have documented resources that may help with implementation.
