# GenPRES Architecture Overview

This file is an **index and landing page** for the architecture documentation. It provides a stable entry point; the full, detailed architecture and design history are documented in:

- `docs/mdr/design-history/architecture.md` – primary technical architecture document

Contributors should start here and then follow the links into the deeper architecture docs under `docs/mdr/`.
