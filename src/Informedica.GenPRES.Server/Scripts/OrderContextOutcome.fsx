// Step 4 of the plan for #985, the server's half: the outcome of GenORDER's evaluation reaches
// the wire as the contract's OrderContextResponse. Three pieces are prototyped here, the rest
// of the step being the retyping of the port and the command handler:
//
// - Filter.dropped (→ GenORDER, Dtos.fs, beside Filter.reconcile): whether the reconciliation
//   let a pick go, which it does silently when the rules no longer offer it for the patient.
//   That is how a seed from the emergency list for a patient outside every rule lands today:
//   the pick vanishes and the page shows the whole list, which is the dead end of #911 and
//   #478 in its current form.
// - PlanContext.evaluateOutcome (→ GenORDER, OrderPlan.fs, beside evaluate): the plan context
//   reconciled, and refused with the context as it was sent when a pick was dropped; else the
//   command run as an outcome and the intake recorded over the answer, a refusal there again
//   carrying the context as sent.
// - OrderContextService.evaluateOutcome (→ ServerApi.Services.fs): the same over the provider,
//   an exception the refusal of the error channel.
// - OrderContextService.toResponse (→ ServerApi.Services.fs): the outcome mapped out as the
//   contract's response, GenORDER's refusal as the contract's.
//
// The plan lane's Navigate and the nutrition discovery keep the message-list evaluate, whose
// refusal is the Dutch message it has always been; a refusal there can only follow a rules
// reload, since the plan holds only contexts that evaluated once.
//
// Run: `dotnet fsi OrderContextOutcome.fsx` from this directory, after `dotnet run build`.
